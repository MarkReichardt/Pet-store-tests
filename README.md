# Pet-store-tests
(homework)
API Testing AssignmentObjectiveThe objective of this assignment is to familiarize yourself with API testing concepts and tools, and to implement automated tests for the Swagger Petstore API. You will choose a suitable test automation framework and create tests that cover functional, negative, and edge case scenarios for at least 5 endpoints of the API. You will demonstrate your ability to handle different HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), query parameters, and path parameters.Task Instructions:
1. Familiarize yourself with the Swagger Petstore API documentation available at: Swagger Petstore API2.
2. Choose a suitable test automation framework (options listed below).
3. Identify at least 5 endpoints from the API that you will test. 
4. Create test scenarios that cover the following types of testing:-Functional Testing: Validate that each endpoint returns the expected response data and status codes.-Negative Testing: Test scenarios where incorrect input or invalid requests are sent to the API. Verify that appropriate error responses are returned.-Edge Case Testing: Test scenarios with boundary values or unusual inputs to ensure the API behaves correctly.
5. Implement automated tests for your identified test scenarios using the chosen test automation framework.6. Ensure that your tests cover handling of different HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), query parameters, and path parameters as specified in the API documentation.Overview of API Testing:-Status Codes: Verify that the API responses return appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g., 200 for success, 404 for not found, 400 for bad request).-Response Types: Validate the structure and content of the response data returned by the API endpoints.-Data Integrity: Ensure that data sent to the API is correctly processed.
-Error Handling: Verify that the API correctly handles and returns error responses for invalid requests or server errors.Tools and Setup Guide:1. Postman: Postman is a popular API testing tool. You can download and install it from the official website: Postman Download2. JavaScript + Supertest: If you choose JavaScript with Supertest, ensure Node.js is installed on your machine. You can install Supertest using npm: `npm install supertest`3. Java + Rest Assured: If you choose Java with Rest Assured, set up a Java development environment and add Rest Assured dependencies to your project. You can add Rest Assured to your Maven project by adding the dependency to your pom.xml.4. C# + RestSharp: If you choose C# with RestSharp, set up a C# development environment and add RestSharp to your project. You can install RestSharp using NuGet Package Manager: `Install-Package RestSharp`Ensure that you follow the documentation and examples provided for your chosen framework to set up your testing environment and create automated tests effectively.Submission:Submit your automated test scripts (via Github link) along with a brief report documenting your test scenarios, the endpoints tested, and any observations or issues encountered during the testing process.
